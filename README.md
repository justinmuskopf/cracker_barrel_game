# cracker_barrel_game
An implementation of Cracker Barrel's iconic "Peg Solitaire" written in Java.

Build:
* `cd` into directory
* `javac BoardGame.java`

Execute:
* `java BoardGame`

**NOTE**: As it is currently implemented, the game is solved for each of the first 5 pegs on execution. This is due to all of the answers after peg 5 being the same, but rotated 120 degrees.
If you wish to change the pegs that the game is played for, then you must change the code in the main method.
